# artpad2.0
This is my HCDE 438 course final project.

ArtPad2.0 is a drawing pad made using the creative coding library, p5.js. In this app, you can change the color and size of the pen, along with the background color. You can also save your artwork to your computer once you are done.

You can try it out at [lu-annie.github.io/artpad2.0/](https://lu-annie.github.io/artpad2.0/)
